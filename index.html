            <h2>Android Mascot</h2>
            <p>
                You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by
                <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices in the world. But maybe you don't
                know that your friendly mascot has a name and a very curious story? Well, keep reading this article to
                learn a lot about this little robot.
            </p>

            <h3>
                The first version
            </h3>
            <p>
                The first attempt to create a mascot came up in 2007 from a developer called <a
                    href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/"
                    target="_blank" class="extern">Dan Morrill</a>.
                He says that he used <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" class="extern">Inkscape</a> (free
                software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was just to personify
                the system just for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.
            </p>

            </picture>

            <p>
                This first bizarre version was even named in honor of its creator: the Dandroids.
            </p>

            <h3>
                A new mascot appears
            </h3>
            <p>
                The idea of having a mascot matured and the mission was handed over to a professional in the area. The
                Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank" class="extern">Irina Blok</a>,
                also Google`s employee, got the 'misison' to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.
            </p>

                <img src="images/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Blok, the Bugdroid creator">
            </picture>

            <p>
                Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The
                drawing should also generate quick identification with the viewer. Then came the
                <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, Android's new mascot.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main inspiration for the features of the new Bugdroid came up from those little dolls that
                illustrate toilets doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating
                on her desk at Google's office and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification was immediate:
                simple, clean, objective.

                    Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a sweet, in
                    alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.

                    Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this
                    fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10.
